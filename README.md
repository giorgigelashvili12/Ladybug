# Ladybug - Useful Message Tool For Developers (What Is This Tool?)
![ladybug](./assets/ladybug.png)
## 0.1.0  - Beta Version
Ladybug is a command-line tool designed to simplify server debugging results, such as error and success messages along with server configurations. Offers a clean UI which allows developers to manage error objects, apply configurations and ensure effecient debugging. Objects offer highly detailed and advanced objects to maximize details about the process that was done. Since this is just a beta and the first version, module only provides large, detailed objects, where configurations aren't set up and don't have much power over your system, which is going to be changed and fixed further version by version.

Simple UI offers different suggestions, such as viewing an error object, updating it, applying server configuration and save & exit.
